  A single Windows server running [WebPageTest](http://www.webpagetest.org/).
instructions: |
  #### Getting Started
  This instance will come online and perform a series of automatic configurations.
  This includes automatic login of a webpagetest user. If you log in to this server
  over RDP, you have to restart the system so the auto login happens again. Otherwise,
  the tests performed with WebPageTest will have black screenshots and video. You will
  need to manage this system with the Java Console in the Control Panel.
  #### Manual Configuration
  There are two manual configuration steps required. Access your server via the Console option in the
  control panel and perform these steps:
  1. Dismiss the blue Network Device Discovery panel on the right hand side of the screen.
  2. Open Internet Explorer, and ensure the WebPageTest Browser Add-on is enabled.
