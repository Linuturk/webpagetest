  A single Windows server running [WebPageTest](http://www.webpagetest.org/).
instructions: |
  #### Getting Started
  This instance will come online and perform a series of automatic configurations.
  This includes automatic login of a webpagetest user. If you log in to this server
  over RDP, you have to restart the system so the auto login happens again. Otherwise,
  the tests performed with WebPageTest will have black screenshots and video. You will
  need to manage this system with the Java Console in the Control Panel.
  #### Automatic Reboots
  An automatic restart of the server will be performed 30 minutes after the system comes online.
  Another automatic reboot will be performed once the system fails the automatic logon process.
  Do not interupt this automatic reboot process.
  #### Manual Configuration
  There are two manual configuration steps required. Access your server via the Console option in the
  control panel and perform these steps:
  1. Dismiss the blue Network Device Discovery panel on the right hand side of the screen.
  2. Open Internet Explorer, and ensure the WebPageTest Browser Add-on is enabled.
  #### Connection Throttling
  Currently, connection throttling is not functional. Your site tests will run using the LAN connection
  setting.
  #### Video Capture
  If you are having trouble with video capture, make sure the Advanced Settings section is open when
  you submit a job. Also ensure the Capture Video option is enabled.
